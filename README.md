# Version-II-of-face_recognition

Using the same open source Face_recognition in Python3. 

But this time I try to change the tolerance rate and do the face location detective.  

I've adjusted the fault tolerance rate, and there are ways to debug the fault tolerance rate in the face distance（辨析度） file.
